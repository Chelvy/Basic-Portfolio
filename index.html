                    Hi, My name is Chelvy Moe-Mackosso. I am a Business System Analyst and Quality Assurance Analyst from Delaware who loves to create beautifully organized applications. 
                    When not up designing or testing, I like enjoying my time with friends and family and participating in outdoors activities like bungee jumping, sky diving, karting, zip lining, water diving, escape room, etc... 
                    I love creating products that are usefull, easy to navigate with a friendly user interface. 
                    At Business level: I understand, gather requirements and create business process using textual modelling and process flow diagrams using visual modelling.
                    At Software level: I create use cases/ wireframes using functional requirements modelling.
                    At Information level: I create entity relationship diagrams (ERD) using data modelling techniques.
